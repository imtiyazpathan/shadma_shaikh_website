====================================

What's included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/ (place your media files and thumbnails here)
- README.md

How to edit:
1. Open `script.js` and update the `clips` array with your clips.
   - For audio set type: "audio" and src: "assets/your-file.mp3"
   - For video set type: "video" and src: "assets/your-file.mp4"
   - Provide a thumbnail in assets and set thumb to the path, or leave thumb empty to get an auto-SVG thumbnail.

2. Replace the sample media files (assets/clip1.mp3, clip2.mp4, etc.) with your real files.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
4. To publish:
   - Upload the files to any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or a standard web host).
   - If using GitHub Pages, push the folder to a repo and enable Pages from the repo settings.

Design notes:
- This is a minimal, accessible, responsive template.
- You can add categories, filtering, or RSS export later.
